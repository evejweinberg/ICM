1.\
INT. HOUSE\
It's hot outside already, and it's only 6 a.m. The Athi River is our only freshwater source, look at it to your left.\
so that's where\
I'm headed.\
I'm 12, but I'm the one who must fetch it;\
\
come with me.\
\
2.\
EXT. VILLAGE\
I join the other women and girls heading to the river for the day. There are more than 800\
households in my village in Makueni County, Kenya. The Athi is three hours away, three back.\
\
3.\
EXT. PATH\
The heat is scorching, but I must make it to the river and back today. The river is polluted with sewage from our capital Nairobi.\
We all get typhoid from the water, from time to time.\

EXT. RIVER\
Finally we are here. The water is slimy, bubbling, murky. I fill my jerry can to its maximum of 5\
gallons. It weighs 18 kilos now\'9740 pounds. This is what I have to get back home.\
5.\
EXT. PATH\
Three hours hours to return to my village. The jerry can is heavy. The heat is miserable. My sister cries\
on my back. I hope I am not too late.\
6.\
EXT. VILLAGE\
If our town had its own well, I would have been able to fetch the water in 15 minutes, not 6 hours.\
If we had a well, my brother wouldn't have caught typhoid in the first place.\
If we had a well, in the time I save each day I could have gone to school.\
If we had a well, I could have grown more vegetables, added to my family's income, eaten a balanced\
diet, and been able to afford medication.\
If we had a well, none of this would have happened in the first place.\
There is no other way out of this spiral.\
Am I in time?\
If not, my brother's name was Kihana. Remember his name.}
